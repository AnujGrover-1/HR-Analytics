# HR-Analytics

The purpose of this case study is to create a model that can predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company using the HR Analytics Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. By analyzing this dataset, management can gain insight into the factors that contribute to employee attrition and identify ways to prevent it.

To accomplish this goal, all project files, including code, data, and documentation, have been saved in a GitHub repository for easy access and collaboration. The project will involve exploring and cleaning the dataset, identifying relevant features, building and training a predictive model, and evaluating its performance.

By understanding which factors contribute to employee attrition, management can take proactive steps to address these issues. For example, they may offer more competitive salaries, provide opportunities for professional development, or improve workplace culture to boost employee morale.

Ultimately, the insights gained from this case study can help organizations reduce employee turnover rates and improve overall employee satisfaction. By investing in their employees and addressing their concerns, companies can create a more productive and positive work environment, leading to greater success and growth.
